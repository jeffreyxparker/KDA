    "\n",
    "Surveys are big business. It's a thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Research is a the act of using surveys to gather **research** on your **market**. Market Research is a whole field of study and profession. Generally, market researchers use surveys to gain insight on new products, brand sentiments and customer satisfaction. Survey respondents may be people who respondent to an email, call or prompt. However, survey respondents may be compensated to get more niche groups. Compensation may take the form of video game credits/upgrades or gift cards and cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Driver Analysis is a methodology branded in market research, called Relative Weights Analysis in Data Science (which can be either Shapley or Johnson's method). Key Drivers Analysis identifies how much each of the predictor variables (the drivers) are moving the depentor variable (key metric, key performance indicator aka KPI). In other words, \"what are the **drivers** of your **key** metric?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Driver Analysis tells you the importance of your predictor variables (independent) on your outcome variable (dependent). It's especially useful when you have highly correllated predictor variables.**\n",

    "### Common uses cases in market research\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Liklihood-to-recommend**: Prioritizing brand perceptions so they have the most impact\n",
    "* **Consideration**: What is going to get millenials to think about purchasing our product?\n",
    "* **Usability**: What makes Apple products so darn easy to use?\n",
    "* **Preception**: Which of the many features is actually impacting overall perceptions?\n",
    "* **Satisfaction**: Is it the nurse, the doctor or the facility that is driving overall experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other use cases out side of market research\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ecommerce**: What served content on a website will most impact a purchase?\n",
    "* **Call Centers**: What wait times and agent interactions will lead to a angry caller?\n",
    "* **Politics**: What candidate attributes (policy or not) will contribute to people's likelihood-to-vote\n",
    "* **Ad Spend**: Spending money on Facebook ads, Google SEO, Email campaigns and more. Which are worth it?\n",
    "* **Attribution**: How do we determine our sales reps commissions? Sometimes they have a hand in other reps sales?"

    "\n",
    "Question: Are there alternatives to Shapley?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes! A method called Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) produces the same Relative Importance scores as Shapley, but it is way faster for large models. These are psuedo-Relative Importance scores and the math is not as intuitive, but if the end is the same, does the means matter?\n",

In other words, if you move all the predictor variables to 5, then the dependent variable moves to 6. In market research, this really isn't a problem, because companies will never be able to get to perfect 5's.\n",
